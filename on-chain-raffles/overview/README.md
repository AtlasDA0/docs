## How the Raffle Operates&#x20;

Once a raffle is created, it appears on our dedicated Raffle explore page. However, the success of your raffle depends on your marketing efforts.

Once the first ticket is sold, the raffle becomes irrevocable, continuing until all tickets are sold or the scheduled conclusion. No cancellations are possible beyond this point.

Post-raffle completion, claim your ticket sale revenue, and a winner is randomly selected. The winner can then claim the NFT prize.
