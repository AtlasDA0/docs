# Creating A Raffle

Initiate a raffle by selecting an NFT from your collection, custom parameters for extended control of your raffle. Parameters include:

* **Raffle duration:** length of time raffle tickets can be purchased
* **Maximum raffle participants:** max number of raffle tickets for sale
* **Price per ticket:** how much you want each ticket to cost
* **Asset for ticket purchase:** what token do you want tickets to be purchased in

Maximum raffle participants & limit per wallet address are optional parameters to set for a raffle, and if ommitted, there is no limit to how many tickets may be purchased for that raffle.
