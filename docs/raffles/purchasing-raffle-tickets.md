# Purchasing Raffle Tickets

To purchase tickets, click on a raffle, choose the desired number of tickets, and proceed.

A raffle owner chooses the amount of tickets able to be purchased for the lifecycle of a raffle, including a wallet limit. These two limits are optional, and if not set, there is no limit to how many tickets may be purchased for that raffle. After the raffle concludes, a winner is randomly selected, and the NFT can be claimed from the escrow contract.

### Terms:

* NFTs held in escrow can be claimed by the winner or creator (in case of no ticket sales) post-draw.
* Raffle tickets are non-refundable.
* No refunds for tickets if you do not win.
