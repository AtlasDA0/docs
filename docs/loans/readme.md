# Non-Custodial Loans
*Put NFT's up as collateral to borrow assets. Fund a Loan to passively collect more tokens. Collect NFT's from defaulted loans.*

### List  Collateral Offer

The lifecycle begins by broadcasting a `list_collateral` to the contract. 
**To participate as a borrower,** you must provide collateral.
 A **loan offer** with your preferences may be accepted, or you may also recieve offers which you may accept or reject.
 In your loan offer, state the desired:
1. **principle capital**
2. **loan duration**,
3. **intrest rewarded to loaner**.

### Create A Loan Offer

**Lenders can loan assets** in pursue of guaranteed return, whether it be:\
\- principle + agreed upon interest\
\- assets in collateral escrow\
**_When the borrower repays the loan, the capital, plus the agreed fee, is returned to the lender._**

### Accept or Reject A Loan Offer
**Upon accepting an offer**, the coins will go in your wallet. Simultaneously, **your collateral is moved into escrow** via smart contract, **for an agreed upon loan period.**

### Repaying The Loan
**Successfully repaying the loan** before its expiration results in the retrieval of your collateral;

### Loan Default
**Defaulting on the repayment of an accepted loan** results in the lender **taking ownership of your collateral!**
