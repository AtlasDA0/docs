# App Fees and Governance Set Params

All contract configurations will have a dao set as the admin able to change these configurations. **These include the values that determine how much from various contract calls require while using the app.** Below displays the values AtlasDAO intends to have set for production use on Stargaze.

### Fees

* a set fee of `100 STARS`, every time a raffle is created
* `10%` of total from raffle ticket sales
* a set fee of `10 STARS`, every time a nft is put up for loan _(collateral deposit)_
* `10%` of repayment from each loan

## Delegate Discounts

A feature to reduce the required fees for app actions if connected account has staked tokens of various communities.
